Date: 10/16/2016

The purpose of this project is to create a SIC or SIC/XE project that will have 10 integers
initiaized in memory via WORD storage.

project2 file: This file contains the SIC/XE program that reverses the order of the numbers

sicModified.doc: This file contains the modified sic.log which shows the original list of
integers and the reversed list of integers.

Procedure for running SIC/XE or SIC programs:

The command SICASM must be entered first and then it will prompt you for the name of the file

After entering the name of the file, command line will return saying that it created two
files: project2. obj and project2.lst.

Then the command SICSIM must be entered. A prompt will appear asking you to A)ccept the files
or R)ename the files.
Enter 'R'
Hit enter past loader until you get to DEVF1 and then enter project2.obj
Continue hitting enter until the prompt appears again. 

Enter 'A', this will accept the program2.obj file
Another prompt will be displayed.

Enter 'S', this will start the project2.obj file
Enter 'R', this will run the project2.obj file. Continue entering 'R' until it says that
it has attempted to read past the file.

Enter 'D, 100-200', this will dump the data stored in memory and will show the integers
entered initially and the integers reversed.
